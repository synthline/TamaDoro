# TamaDoro notes #1

device based on Arduino that can:

1. show the time, date, temperature & humidity and has an alarm function

2. Has a pomodoro function where you can set the 'pomodoro time', the pause time, a long pause time and after how many pomodoro cycles you can have a long break.
when pomodoro on, there will be a red light on with a cable that can be mounted on desk or on monitor to indicate to your colleagues that you're busy, and equally a green one when you're on break.
Gives a short audio sound when status changes as well as a small light.

addons:
 - The dates, times and durations of the pomodoro will be stored and can be exported at any time into a csv file.
- Stats based on the hours can be shwon locally. 
- The data can be automatically sent to a mail every month. 

3. Has a Tamagochi function where the amount of time registered by the pomodoro gets converted into food that feeds the pet. 
equally, the amount of breaks you take will affect the happiness of the pet. 

At the end of the day, you need to put your pet to sleep. You can program when it will wake up and say hello to you.

the original names of the pokemons will be altered by a smart anti-IP diffuser.
